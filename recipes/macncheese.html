    <h1>Mac and cheese with tenderstem broccoli</h1>
    <div><img src="./images-recipes/mcheese.jpg" width="300px" alt="Mac'n'Cheese"></div>
    <h3>Simple, easy-to-make mac and cheese</h3>
    <p>This mac and cheese is served with a portion of fried tenderstem broccoli
        on the side. The reason we don't mix them is because we want to fry the
        broccoli in oil to give it a delicious flavor and eat it as a salad.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wholegrain durum wheat</li>
        <li>Any type of cheese that can easily melt</li>
        <li>Tenderstem broccoli</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water</li>
        <li>Add durum wheat into boiling water and cook until preference</li>
        <li>In the meantime, fry the broccoli in a pan with olive oil, salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Once the broccoli is fried (usually in about 5 minutes), take it out and place it on a plate</li>
        <li>Once the durum wheat is cooked and tender, take the remaining water out and add cheese in there</li>
        <li>Mix the durum wheat with the cheese until you obtain mac and cheese (the cheese will melt since the durum wheat is still hot)</li>
        <li>Place it on a plate</li>
        <li>Enjoy it!</li>
    </ol>
