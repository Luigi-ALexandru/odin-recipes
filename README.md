# odin-recipes
This is my 1st project following TOP tutorial on becoming a WebDev. The project consists of creating a basic recipe website. I am using git to clone from GitHub, using the terminal.

Update - I have now finished the recipes project! I have learned how to add, commit and push the changes that I make within my project using Git. Now everybody can see my code as I'm sharing it thanks to the git/github interconnectivity. At first it was a bit confusing but it all makes sense now. :)
